> From StarGeek:
> One very important thing to take note of is that Google Photos does not remove the metadata from the files.  The files you downloaded have exactly the same data that was there when uploaded.
> 
> Unless you have made modifications to the data on the Google Photos website, you do not need to merge the json data into the files.  The data is already there.
> 
> If you take a look and compare the GeoData* tags with the GeoDataExif* tags, you'll see that they are the same.  the GeoDataExif* tags are what was in the file when it was uploaded and are still in the file.
